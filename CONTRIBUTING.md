## Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/React

## Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We use GitHub issues to track feature requests as well. When submitting a feature request:

- Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature
- Explain why this feature would be useful
- Include examples or mockups if applicable

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Dependencies

Before adding new dependencies:
- Check if the functionality can be achieved with existing dependencies
- Ensure the dependency is actively maintained
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Update both `package.json` and `requirements.txt` as needed

```bash
cd frontend
npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component-name]
```

### Database Changes

- Always create migration scripts for database schema changes
- Test migrations thoroughly before submitting
- Update documentation for any API changes

## Code Review Process

All submissions require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.
