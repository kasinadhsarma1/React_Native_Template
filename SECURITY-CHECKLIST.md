# Security Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

### Environment & Configuration
- [ ] All environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] No secrets are hardcoded in the source code
- [ ] `.env` files are in `.gitignore` and not committed
- [ ] Production secrets are stored securely (not in plain text)
- [ ] Debug mode is disabled in production
- [ ] Strong, unique secrets are used for JWT and other security tokens

### Dependencies & Packages
- [ ] All dependencies are updated to latest secure versions
- [ ] `npm audit` shows no high/critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] `safety check` (Python) shows no known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Dependabot alerts are enabled and monitored
- [ ] Only necessary packages are included (no unused dependencies)

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] JWT tokens have reasonable expiration times
- [ ] Password requirements are enforced (length, complexity)
- [ ] Password hashing uses bcrypt or similar secure algorithms
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented for login attempts
- [ ] Session management is secure
- [ ] User input validation is implemented everywhere

### API Security
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured for all endpoints
- [ ] CORS is properly configured (not `*` in production)
- [ ] Input validation using Pydantic models
- [ ] SQL injection protection (parameterized queries)
- [ ] API documentation is disabled in production (or protected)
- [ ] Error messages don't reveal sensitive information

### Frontend Security
- [ ] XSS protection is implemented
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP) is configured
- [ ] `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is avoided or sanitized
- [ ] User inputs are validated and sanitized
- [ ] Sensitive data is not stored in localStorage
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced in production

### Backend Security
- [ ] Security headers are implemented (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] Database connections are secure
- [ ] File upload security is implemented (if applicable)
- [ ] Logging doesn't include sensitive data
- [ ] Error handling doesn't expose system details

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates are valid and properly configured
- [ ] Firewall rules are restrictive
- [ ] Database access is restricted
- [ ] Backup procedures are secure
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting are configured
- [ ] Regular security updates are applied

### Code Security
- [ ] Code has been reviewed for security issues
- [ ] Security scanning tools have been run (Bandit, ESLint security)
- [ ] No commented-out code containing secrets
- [ ] Git history doesn't contain committed secrets
- [ ] Security tests are included in test suites

### Monitoring & Incident Response
- [ ] Security logs are configured and monitored
- [ ] Incident response plan is in place
- [ ] Security contacts are documented
- [ ] Regular security audits are scheduled
- [ ] Vulnerability disclosure process is documented

## Production Security Monitoring

### Daily Checks
- [ ] Review security logs for anomalies
- [ ] Monitor failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Check for new security alerts/vulnerabilities

### Weekly Checks
- [ ] Run automated security scans
- [ ] Review and update dependencies
- [ ] Check for new CVEs affecting your stack

### Monthly Checks
- [ ] Comprehensive security audit
- [ ] Review and update security policies
- [ ] Test incident response procedures
- [ ] Review access controls and permissions

### Quarterly Checks
- [ ] Penetration testing or security assessment
- [ ] Review and update security training
- [ ] Update security documentation
- [ ] Review and rotate secrets/keys

## Security Tools Used

### Frontend
- ✅ ESLint Security Plugin

## Common Vulnerabilities Prevented

### OWASP Top 10 Coverage
1. **Injection** - ✅ Parameterized queries, input validation
2. **Broken Authentication** - ✅ Secure session management, strong passwords
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure** - ✅ Encryption, secure storage
4. **XML External Entities (XXE)** - ✅ Input validation
5. **Broken Access Control** - ✅ Proper authorization checks
6. **Security Misconfiguration** - ✅ Secure defaults, hardening
7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** - ✅ Input sanitization, CSP
8. **Insecure Deserialization** - ✅ Validation, safe practices
9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities** - ✅ Dependency scanning
10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring** - ✅ Comprehensive logging
