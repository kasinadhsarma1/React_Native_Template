## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

1. **Do NOT create a public GitHub issue** for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email us directly** at [kasinadhsarma@gmail.com] with the subject line "Security Vulnerability Report"
3. **Include the following information:**
   - Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
   - The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress toward resolving the issue
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical security issues within 30 days
- **Credit**: With your permission, we will credit you in our security advisory

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Frontend Security

1. **Input Validation**
   - Always validate and sanitize user inputs
   - Use React's built-in XSS protection
   - Avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`

2. **Dependencies**
   - Regularly update dependencies using `npm audit`
   - Use tools like Snyk or Dependabot for vulnerability scanning
   - Pin dependency versions in package.json

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement proper session management
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Store sensitive data securely

### Backend Security

1. **API Security**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use CORS properly
   - Validate all inputs using Pydantic models
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization

2. **Database Security**
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit secrets to version control
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Rotate secrets regularly

## Security Features Implemented

### Current Security Measures

1. **Dependency Security**
   - Package overrides for known vulnerabilities
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Security scanning with Dependabot

2. **Code Security**
   - ESLint security rules
   - Python security linting with bandit
   - Input validation on both frontend and backend

3. **Infrastructure Security**
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - Security headers implementation
   - CORS configuration

### Planned Security Enhancements

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT implementation
   - Role-based access control
   - Multi-factor authentication

2. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Security event logging
   - Intrusion detection
   - Audit trails

3. **Encryption**
   - Data encryption at rest
   - Secure communication protocols
   - Key management

## Security Checklist for Deployment

## Common Security Vulnerabilities to Avoid

### OWASP Top 10 Prevention

1. **Injection**: Use parameterized queries and input validation
2. **Broken Authentication**: Implement secure session management
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Encrypt data in transit and at rest
4. **XML External Entities (XXE)**: Validate and sanitize XML input
5. **Broken Access Control**: Implement proper authorization
6. **Security Misconfiguration**: Follow security best practices
7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Sanitize user input and use CSP
8. **Insecure Deserialization**: Validate serialized data
9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**: Keep dependencies updated
10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging

## Security Tools and Resources

### Recommended Tools

- **Frontend**: ESLint Security Plugin, Snyk, npm audit
